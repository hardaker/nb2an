nb2an: Netbox to Ansible
=================================

`NetBox <https://www.netbox.dev/>`__ and
`Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`__ both require a lot of manual

can be a daunting challenge. The **nb2an** package provides utilities to
map NetBox values to ansible *host_vars* using a simple mapping file.
